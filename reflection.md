# Milestone 2

## Description
Describe what you did for this milestone in your own words.

For this milestone, we used and dereferenced pointers, while tracking the activity of those objects.  Determining whether the player was still active will determine if the game ends or not. If the player 
projectile is to intersect the opponent object, the score SHOULD add one point.

## Challenges encountered
Describe the challenges you encountered while working on this milestone of the project.
logic, Logic, LOGIC.  The hardest part for me in this milestone was being able to understand what the readme says, and implement the correct steps to reach the desired output. Example, when taking the score, for whatever reason I get an issue with the score only adding when the opponent kills me.

## Things I've learned
What is the most important thing you've learned from this milestone in the project?

Overall, the most important thing I learned from this milestone is to practice pointers a bit more backause, I found myself having to fix many errors on calling them incorectly due to lack of attention to detail.  Other than that just LOGIC!
